# Inverse dockerignore is broken. It kind of worked by accident in some cases.
# The behavior of `COPY . ../../` + `docker build [...] ../../` changes based
#  on the current working directory and may-or-may-not include entire service
#  directories (e.g. the real-time build saw clsi, but not document-updater;
#  the document-updater build could see it-self).
# No work around exists. Just ignore the major offenders for now.
# See upstream ticket: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30018
